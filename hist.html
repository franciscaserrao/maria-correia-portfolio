        <p><strong>Stake Holder Interview</strong></p>
        A conversation with Bruno, the founder, helped clarify the school's core
        values, including its personalized coaching approach and emphasis on
        community. Bruno’s vision was to make surfing accessible to everyone and
        introduce complementary activities like surfskate in the future.
      </div>

      <div class="description">
        <p><strong>Qualitative Research:</strong></p>
        5 interviews provided insights into the school's strengths, such as the
        personalized coaching, video feedback, and tight-knit community, while
        highlighting areas for improvement, like the absence of a student portal
        and lesson bundles.
      </div>

      <div class="description">
        <p><strong>Market Research:</strong></p>
        The team conducted secondary research that revealed over 23 million
        surfers worldwide, with Portugal hosting a large number of surfers,
        particularly in Lisbon. Despite this, many surf schools offered similar
        services with little differentiation, making it crucial for High
        Intensity to improve its online presence to attract new customers.

        <p><strong>Persona & Journey Map </strong></p>

        The user persona, Willy Wave, a 29-year-old digital nomad and passionate
        surfer, encapsulated the target audience. Willy’s journey revealed pain
        points like the difficulty in navigating multiple channels for
        information and the lack of a consolidated platform to manage lessons
        and feedback.

      <div class="subsubtitle">Solution & Concept</div>

      <div class="description">
        <p><strong>Problem Statement</strong></p>
        Young adults with surfing experience in Lisbon need a way to improve
        their skills with personalized coaching while also having access to an
        organized system for booking lessons, managing payments, and tracking
        progress. They struggle with fragmented information across different
        channels.
      </div>

      <div class="description">
        <p><strong>E-Commerce concept</strong></p>
        E-commerce website that would help High Intensity stand out in a
        competitive market, providing an intuitive and organized online
        experience for users to book lessons, purchase packages, and access
        personalized feedback from coaches.
      </div>

      <div class="subsubtitle">Design Process</div>

      <div class="description">
        <p><strong>Affinity Diagram</strong></p>
        The team synthesized research into an affinity diagram to identify key
        themes, ultimately defining the problem: users require a seamless,
        centralized platform that combines lesson booking, progress tracking,
        and community interaction.
      </div>

      <div class="description">
        <p><strong>MVP</strong></p>
        The team used ideation methods like Crazy 8 and Moscow Prioritization to
        arrive at the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). The MVP focused on key
        features: an e-commerce homepage, a user-friendly portal, and a
        streamlined checkout process.
      </div>

      <div class="description">
        <p><strong>Prototype</strong></p>
        <p>
          Low Fidelity Prototype was created and tested with users (concept
          test). Feedback led to improvements such as simplifying the purchasing
          process, replacing "lessons" with "activities" in the navigation, and
          integrating a student portal for easier access to course materials and
          feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the Midi - fi prototype we used the usability test revealed that
          users appreciated the student portal and ease of purchasing classes.
          The site map and user flow were refined to ensure clarity and
          efficiency. The team also considered whether separate user flows were
          needed for current students versus new clients but decided to keep a
          single flow for simplicity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The high-fidelity prototype of the e-commerce website featured a
          clean, modern design with clear calls to action and an
          easy-to-navigate student portal. Desirability test was used and let us
          received positive feedback, with users indicating a high level of
          satisfaction regarding the branding and functionality.

      <div class="description">
        <p><strong>Branding & UI Design</strong></p>
        <p>
          Given that High Intensity lacked a clear brand identity, the team
          created a mood board based on five brand attributes—fun,
          community-oriented, trustworthy, inspiring, and empowering. The final
          branding elements were tested with stakeholders to ensure they
          resonated with the target audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          A style tile was developed to ensure consistency in colors,
          typography, and overall aesthetic across the site.
        </p>

      <div class="description">
        <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
        This project was an exciting and challenging opportunity to design a
        solution that would help High Intensity Surf School reach more students
        while providing a seamless and engaging online experience. The team’s
        iterative approach, user-centered design, and strong collaboration led
        to a product that effectively addresses the needs of both the business
        and its target audience.
