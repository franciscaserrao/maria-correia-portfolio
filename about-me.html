      <div class="about-1st-paragraph">
        My name is Maria, and I want to introduce myself so that you can get to
        know me better. “There are many Marias” (I know), but I would like to
        explain what makes me unique.
      </div>
      <div class="about-1st-paragraph">
        As a middle child, I developed the ability to be less visible and more
        dreamy. Thirty years later, I still enjoy dreaming, but I realized that
        turning what we imagine into reality is more useful and fun. We stop
        playing pretend and start living it. This, of course, if we are brave
        enough to take the risk!

      <div class="about-2nd-paragraph">
        For me, the course in UX/UI at Ironhack was my game changer, because it
        helped me to move from social work, where I could have impact in
        people's life, to a design world where I can still have impact on
        society but doing it while I have fun and develop myself!
      </div>
      <div class="about-2nd-paragraph">
        During this time I learned that what truly captivates me, it's the
        process. "Trust the process" is a phrase that remains very present in my
        life, a philosophy I embraced during the Bootcamp at Ironhack.
      </div>
      <div class="about-2nd-paragraph">
        I believe my professional experience as a social worker is a significant
        advantage. This role taught me to handle adverse situations and, in
        record time, find the best solutions.
      </div>
      <div class="about-2nd-paragraph">
        In the past year I embraced some projects as a freelancer, and I still
        do. Those roles gave me the opportunity to grow as a professional.
      </div>
      <div class="about-2nd-paragraph">
        In the future, I want to continue supporting projects that improve
        people's lives.
      </div>
      <div class="about-2nd-paragraph">
        While I was handling all this professionally, I was also having fun in
        my personal life doing things like:

        <div class="row">
          <img src="content/smile.jpg" alt="Maria smiling" />
          <div>
            <div class="ps-title">Smile.</div>
            <div class="ps-text">
              A Smile provides us with good moments. It is an expression of our
              happy side. Seeing someone smile, is contagious and makes you want
              to smile too. It works in both ways. A smile a day, keeps the
              doctor away!
            </div>

        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <img src="content/surf.jpg" alt="Maria surfing" />
          <div>
            <div class="ps-title">Surf.</div>
            <div class="ps-text">
              Surf is not just a sport for me. It is a school of soft skills. It
              is a place where I connect with nature (for good and for bad), a
              moment that I share with others and it's something that challenges
              myself to be better. Surfing has shown me that with commitment and
              work the improvement is guaranteed.

          <div>
            <div class="ps-title">Dance.</div>
            <div class="ps-text">
              Dancing is something that I've done for as long as I can remember.
              For me, dancing is the moment where I shed all my inhibitions and
              just have some fun. As my mother says: “You have to dance like
              nobody is looking at you”!
